# github-tracker

## Costs

As this is a project I am doing for fun, there is no source of revenue for this project and I am also not intending to add any.    
And as running backend services and hosting applications usually has costs associated with it, I am **draining money** with this project.

Essentially, I need to pay GCP bills every month.  
This **limits** how much/often etc. I process data for GitHub tracker as I cannot burn an unlimited amount of money for this project - although I am willing to burn quite a bit because I *like* the project (:

I am not sure what to do about this yet. [Let me know][dm] if you have any ideas :)
