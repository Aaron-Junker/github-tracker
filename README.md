Tracking the top 100 GitHub software repos.

## Costs

Because of costs for backend services required to operate GitHub Tracker, I am **draining money** with this project, which is fine as I enjoy doing it.

Essentially, I need to pay GCP bills every month.  
This **limits** how much/often I can process data for GitHub Tracker etc. as I cannot burn an unlimited amount of money for this project - although I am willing to burn quite a bit because I *like* the project (:

I am not sure what to do about this yet. [Let me know][dm] if you have any ideas :)
